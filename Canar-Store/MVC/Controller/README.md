The controller in MVC is responsible for handling the interactions between the user, the view, and the model. It is responsible for handling user requests, retrieving the necessary data from the model, and passing it to the view for display.

The primary role of the controller is to separate the presentation and control logic from the business logic of the application. In other words, the controller is not concerned with how data is stored or manipulated, but rather with how users interact with the application and how the data is presented.

The controller is also responsible for handling user actions, such as form submissions or button clicks, and redirecting the user to the appropriate view based on those actions. It may also be responsible for handling errors and exceptions, and updating the model based on user actions.
